# USART driver asynchronous - USART echo

This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in asynchronous mode.

## Description

This example uses the USART driver in asynchronous mode in Bare-Metal environment to communicate over the console. It receives and echo's back the characters entered by the user.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_pic32mx) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
    - [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board

### Setting up [Curiosity PIC32MX470 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320103)

- Connect mini USB cable to the 'Debug USB' connector(J3) on the board to the computer
- Install the [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board on to the mikroBUS socket J5 of [Curiosity PIC32MX470 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320103)
- Connect mini USB cable to the [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board. This will enumerate the USB to UART port
- **Note:** Ensure that the series resistors on the mikroBUS headers are of value 0 Ohms

### Setting up [PIC32MX274 XLP Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320105)

- Connect micro USB cable to the 'Debug USB' connector(J9) on the board to the computer
- Install the [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board on to the mikroBUS socket J5 of [PIC32MX274 XLP Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320105)
- Connect mini USB cable to the [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board. This will enumerate the USB to UART port

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. Type a character and observe the output on the console as shown below:

    ![output_async_usart_echo](images/output_async_usart_echo.png)

5. LED toggles each time the character is echoed

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [Curiosity PIC32MX470 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320103) | LED1 |
|  [PIC32MX274 XLP Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320105) | LED1(RED) |
